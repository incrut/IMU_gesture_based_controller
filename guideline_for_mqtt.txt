Install MQTT Broker on Raspberry Pi:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients

Find IP of the devise running MQTT (RasPi):
    ip a
    ping public_ip (on the other devise try accessing it via ping pub ip of the RasPi running the MQTT)
    
To run the MQTT server:
    sudo systemctl start mosquitto
    sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
    sudo systemctl status mosquitto (to check if the server is running or not)
    
To stop the MQTT server:
    sudo systemctl stop mosquitto
    sudo systemctl disable mosquitto
    sudo systemctl status mosquitto (to check if the server is running or not)

To check MQTT broker logs:
    sudo tail /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log
    
To restart the MQTT server:
    sudo systemctl restart mosquitto

Firewall Check (it usually blocks the connection to the server (and the vnc also)):
    sudo apt-get install ufw
    
    sudo ufw status
    sudo ufw allow 1883 (allows traffic (incoming connections) on port 1883 (the one we use for Pico-RasPi connection as it is default MQTT port))
    
    sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 1883 (if we need to check whether Mosquitto is listening on port 1883)
    
    sudo ufw enable (enable the firewall)

Open the Mosquitto configuration file for editing. The default location is /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:
    sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
    
Look for the line that starts with listener. It might look like this:
    listener 1883

Change it to listen on all available network interfaces:
    listener 1883 0.0.0.0 (If there is no listener line in the mosquitto.conf file, you can add it)
    
Ensure that the configuration file allows connections with the given username and password. 
Look for lines like allow_anonymous, and make sure it's set to false. If there is no such line, you can add it:    
    allow_anonymous false 

Ensure that your Mosquitto broker requires authentication. 
Open the Mosquitto configuration file and look for the password_file directive. 
This should point to a file containing usernames and hashed passwords.
    password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

Save and exit mosquitto.conf

Create a Password File:
Use the mosquitto_passwd command to create a password file and add a user:
    sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd your_username

If you need to add more users later, omit the -c option:
    sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd another_username

Check Mosquitto Logs: Examine the logs of the Mosquitto broker for any error messages or additional information:
    sudo journalctl -u mosquitto -e


To fix VNC after that we need:
    sudo ufw status (check if it is installed and active)
    sudo ufw allow 22      # Allow SSH
    sudo ufw allow 80      # Allow HTTP
    sudo ufw allow 443     # Allow HTTPS
    sudo ufw allow icmp    # Allow ICMP (ping)
    sudo ufw allow 1883    # Allow port 1883 for mqtt
    sudo ufw allow 5900    # Allow VNC (port 5900)

    sudo ufw reload (after making changes, reload UFW to apply the new rules)

    sudo iptables -L (You can also check the current iptables rules directly, This command will display the current firewall rules)
